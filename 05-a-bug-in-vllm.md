# A bug in vLLM 0.27.1 — Gemma-4 will not load

**Status: found here, diagnosed, patched locally — and fixed upstream
independently.**

On the stable release, 0.27.1, Gemma-4 would not load at all. The cause is
below, and the patch that fixes it is in `../harness/fix_gemma4.py`.

Later the same day a vLLM nightly build loaded the same model with no patch and
measured the same throughput, so the defect is gone from current code. The patch
is only of use to someone pinned to 0.27.1 — and it is worth keeping in this
repository as a worked example, because the interesting part was never the patch
but the diagnosis: the failure looked like a broken model file and was not.

**A patch applied this way is erased by the next upgrade.** It edits a file
inside an installed package, so `pip install --upgrade` silently replaces it.
That is a general hazard, not a property of this bug.

## Symptom

Any Gemma-4 model in a native quantised format fails to start on vLLM 0.27.1.
Both variants tested fail, from different publishers and different quantisation
toolchains, so it is not a bad checkpoint:

- `nvidia/Gemma-4-26B-A4B-NVFP4` — modelopt, MoE
- `RedHatAI/gemma-4-12B-it-NVFP4` — compressed-tensors, dense

Two errors appear, one after the other. The second only becomes visible once the
first is worked around.

## Defect 1 — an exception caught by the wrong name

```
transformers.integrations.heterogeneity.configuration_utils.
AmbiguousGlobalPerLayerAttributeError: 'head_dim' is a per-layer attribute...
```

Raised from `vllm/transformers_utils/model_arch_config_convertor.py:608`:

```python
head_dim = getattr(self.hf_text_config, "head_dim", 0)
```

The default argument shows the author expected the attribute to be *absent* on
some configs. Transformers 5.15 does not report it absent; it raises. And
`AmbiguousGlobalPerLayerAttributeError` subclasses **`RuntimeError`, not
`AttributeError`**, so `getattr`'s default does not catch it and startup dies.

**Workaround.** The exception message names its own escape hatch. Add one key to
the model's `config.json`, inside `text_config`:

```json
"allow_global_per_layer_attribute_access": true
```

`benchmark/harness/patch_gemma_cfg.py` does this and keeps a `.orig` backup. This is safe
here: vLLM wants the global value in order to size buffers for the largest case,
which is exactly the use the warning permits.

## Defect 2 — layers built with the wrong dimensions

Getting past defect 1 reveals the real problem:

```
AssertionError: Attempted to load weight (torch.Size([512]))
                into parameter (torch.Size([256]))
```

Gemma-4 mixes two attention shapes:

| Layer type | Count | `head_dim` | key-value heads |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| sliding attention | 25 | 256 | 8 |
| full attention | 5 | **512** | **2** |

Older transformers published the second set under the names `global_head_dim`
and `num_global_key_value_heads`, and `vllm/model_executor/models/gemma4.py`
reads exactly those names:

```python
if self.is_full_attention:
    head_dim = getattr(config, "global_head_dim", config.head_dim)
else:
    head_dim = config.head_dim
```

**Transformers 5.15 removed both names** and publishes the authoritative values
per layer, in `config.per_layer_config[i]`. So `getattr` finds nothing, falls
back to the sliding-layer value, and every one of the 30 layers is built with
head_dim 256 and 8 key-value heads. Loading then fails on the first
full-attention layer.

Instrumented output confirming it — `global_head_dim` is `None` for all layers,
including the ones marked `full_attention`:

```
[DBG] layer=5  type=full_attention    chosen=256 cfg.head_dim=256 cfg.global_head_dim=None
[DBG] layer=11 type=full_attention    chosen=256 cfg.head_dim=256 cfg.global_head_dim=None
[DBG] layer=17 type=full_attention    chosen=256 cfg.head_dim=256 cfg.global_head_dim=None
```

## The checkpoint is fine

Before blaming vLLM, the safetensors headers were read directly and compared
against the config, layer by layer: **25 layers at 256, 5 at 512, zero
mismatches.** What transformers exposes also matches:

```
per_layer_config head_dim            {256: 25, 512: 5}
per_layer_config num_key_value_heads {8: 25, 2: 5}
```

## The patch

`benchmark/harness/fix_gemma4.py`. It prefers the per-layer value where transformers
provides one and keeps the old lookup as a fallback, so it is safe on older
transformers too. Two blocks changed in `gemma4.py`:

```python
_per_layer = getattr(config, "per_layer_config", None)
_lc = (_per_layer[layer_idx]
       if _per_layer is not None and layer_idx < len(_per_layer) else None)

if _lc is not None and getattr(_lc, "head_dim", None):
    head_dim = _lc.head_dim
elif self.is_full_attention:
    head_dim = getattr(config, "global_head_dim", config.head_dim)
else:
    head_dim = config.head_dim
```

and the same shape for `num_kv_heads`, reading `_lc.num_key_value_heads`.

Applied to
`/opt/ai/vllm/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/vllm/model_executor/models/gemma4.py`,
with the pristine file kept as `gemma4.py.orig`.

## Verification — loading is not the same as working

A model built with wrong layer sizes could load and emit nonsense, so the fixed
model was compared against **the same model in GGUF on llama.cpp**, which never
had the bug:

| Measurement | NVFP4 / vLLM, patched | GGUF / llama.cpp | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| chrF++ average | 69.68 | 69.50 | +0.18 |
| chrF++ Romanian | 68.68 | 67.90 | +0.78 |
| chrF++ French | 77.55 | 77.10 | +0.45 |
| chrF++ Ukrainian | 63.80 | 64.60 | −0.80 |
| Classification F1 | 0.969 | 0.968 | +0.001 |
| Coding | 10/10 | 10/10 | — |

Every difference sits inside measurement noise, across all seven languages. The
model computes correctly.

## Regression check — nothing else was disturbed

Only one file was modified, and it is loaded solely for Gemma-4 models. Verified
empirically on a non-Gemma model:

| | before the patch | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| Qwopus-27B, articles/s at c=8 | 17.64 | 17.67 |

## What it unlocks

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Gemma-4 on vLLM | does not start | works |
| Throughput at c=32 | — | **159.6 articles/s**, ×17.6 over one request |
| Prompt reading | — | 15 611 tok/s |

Against the same model on llama.cpp — 8.1 articles/s at its best — this is a
twenty-fold difference in bulk throughput.

## Reporting upstream

Not yet done. It should be, because 0.27.1 is the current release and there is
no newer version to upgrade to. A report needs:

1. Minimal reproduction: `vllm serve nvidia/Gemma-4-26B-A4B-NVFP4` on
   transformers 5.15.
2. Both tracebacks.
3. The observation that `AmbiguousGlobalPerLayerAttributeError` derives from
   `RuntimeError`, which is why the `getattr` default does not shield the caller.
4. The patch above, as a pull request.

Worth checking first whether an issue already exists, and whether the `main`
branch has moved.

## After any vLLM upgrade

```bash
pct exec 102 -- ls -la /opt/ai/vllm/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/vllm/model_executor/models/ | grep gemma4
# if gemma4.py.orig is gone, the package was replaced and the patch with it
pct exec 102 -- /opt/ai/vllm/.venv/bin/python /tmp/fix_gemma4.py   # from harness/
```

Then start a Gemma model and run one classification pass. If F1 lands near
0.969, the fix took.
